# CodeClause_TimerAndStopwatch
Welcome to the Timer and Stopwatch Project using Web Development!

This project is a simple web application that allows you to track time using a timer and a stopwatch. You can use it to time your activities, workouts, study sessions, or any other task that requires tracking time.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes two separate timers: a countdown timer and a stopwatch. The countdown timer allows you to set a specific time limit and counts down to zero. The stopwatch, on the other hand, allows you to start, stop, and reset the timer as needed.
